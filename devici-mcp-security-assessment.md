  - Access to sensitive system files
  - Reading configuration files of other applications
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive local files
- **Affected Functions:** `analyze_project_structure`, `analyze_project_dependencies`

#### T003: Insufficient Input Validation  
- **STRIDE Category:** Tampering, Information Disclosure
- **Risk:** User inputs not properly validated or sanitized
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Malicious file paths in API requests
  - Code injection through project analysis
  - Parameter manipulation
- **Impact:** File system access bypass, potential code execution
- **Current State:** Limited input validation observed

#### T006: Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion
- **STRIDE Category:** Denial of Service  
- **Risk:** No rate limiting or resource constraints
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Excessive API requests to Devici platform
  - Large file analysis operations
  - Memory exhaustion through recursive operations
- **Impact:** Service unavailability, resource consumption
- **Current State:** No rate limiting implemented

#### T008: Insecure HTTP Communication
- **STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure, Tampering
- **Risk:** Potential for unencrypted API communication
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks if HTTPS not enforced
  - Credential interception
  - API response tampering
- **Impact:** Data exposure, communication compromise
- **Current State:** HTTPS enforcement not explicitly validated

### LOWER SEVERITY THREATS

#### T005: Excessive Error Information Disclosure
- **STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure
- **Risk:** Detailed error messages may expose system information
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Stack traces revealing file paths
  - Database error messages
  - API error details
- **Impact:** Information reconnaissance for further attacks
- **Severity:** Low (limited direct impact)

#### T007: Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities
- **STRIDE Category:** Various (depends on specific vulnerabilities)
- **Risk:** Third-party dependencies may contain known CVEs
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in dependencies
  - Supply chain attacks
  - Transitive dependency issues
- **Impact:** Variable (depends on specific vulnerabilities)
- **Dependencies:** httpx, mcp, pydantic, python-dotenv, anyio

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Implement Authentication & Authorization**
   - Add MCP client authentication mechanism
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Consider API key or certificate-based authentication

2. **Secure Credential Management**
   - Move from environment variables to secure secret storage
   - Implement credential encryption at rest
   - Use services like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault
   - Add credential rotation capabilities

### Medium-Term Actions

3. **File System Security**
   - Implement strict path validation and canonicalization
   - Create sandboxed directories for file operations
   - Add file type and size restrictions
   - Implement chroot or containerization

4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Add comprehensive input validation for all API parameters
   - Implement allowlist-based validation for file paths
   - Sanitize user inputs before processing
   - Add request schema validation

5. **Rate Limiting & Resource Controls**
   - Implement per-client rate limiting
   - Add timeout controls for long-running operations
   - Set memory and CPU usage limits
   - Implement circuit breakers for external API calls

6. **Communication Security**
   - Enforce HTTPS for all external communications
   - Implement certificate pinning
   - Add request/response integrity validation
   - Consider mutual TLS authentication

### Ongoing Security Practices

7. **Error Handling Security**
   - Implement secure error messages that don't expose internals
   - Log detailed errors securely for debugging
   - Return generic error messages to clients

8. **Dependency Management**
   - Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Regular dependency updates and security patches
   - Use dependency pinning and lock files
   - Monitor security advisories

## Conclusion

The Devici MCP server provides valuable functionality for threat modeling integration but currently lacks essential security controls. The most critical issues are the absence of authentication mechanisms and insecure credential management. Implementing the recommended security measures will significantly improve the project's security posture while maintaining its functional capabilities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Address high-severity threats immediately
2. Develop a security implementation roadmap
3. Establish security review processes
4. Consider security-focused code review practices
